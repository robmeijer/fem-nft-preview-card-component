## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is another front-end challenge attempt.

The icon overlay was a real challenge, but managed to figure it out in the end.

### Continued development

Would like to try implement the icon overlay using a pseudo-element instead.

### Useful resources
